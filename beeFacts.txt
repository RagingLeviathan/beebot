Bees have 5 eyes.\r\n
Bees are insects, so they have 6 legs.\r\n
Male bees in the hive are called drones.\r\n
Bees fly about 20 mph.\r\n
Female bees in the hive (except the queen) are called worker bees.\r\n
Number of eggs laid by queen: 2,000 per day is the high.\r\n
Losing its stinger will cause a bee to die.\r\n
Bees have been here about 30 million years!\r\n
Bees carry pollen on their hind legs in a pollen basket or corbicula.\r\n
An average beehive can hold around 50,000 bees.\r\n
Foragers must collect nectar from about 2 million flowers to make 1 pound of honey.\r\n
The average forager makes about 1/12 th of a teaspoon of honey in her lifetime.\r\n
Average per capita honey consumption in the US is 1.3 pounds.\r\n
Bees have 2 pairs of wings.\r\n
The principal form of communication among honey bees is through chemicals called pheromones.\r\n
Bees are important because they pollinate approximately 130 agricultural crops in the US including fruit, fiber, nut, and vegetable crops. Bee pollination adds approximately 14 billion dollars annually to improved crop yield and quality.\r\n
Many people notice that dictionaries list honeybee as one word. However, entomologists use the two-word naming convention honey bee. Both are correct!\r\n
The honey bee is the only insect that produces food eaten by man.\r\n
A honey bee can fly for up to six miles, and as fast as 15 miles per hour, hence it would have to fly around 90,000 miles -three times around the globe – to make one pound of honey.\r\n
It takes one ounce of honey to fuel a bee’s flight around the world.\r\n
Honey is 80% sugars and 20% water.\r\n
Honey bees produce beeswax from eight paired glands on the underside of their abdomen.\r\n
Honey bees must consume about 17-20 pounds of honey to be able to biochemically produce each pound of beeswax.\r\n
Bees maintain a temperature of 92-93 degrees Fahrenheit in their central brood nest regardless of whether the outside temperature is 110 or -40 degrees.\r\n
A populous colony may contain 40,000 to 60,000 bees during the late spring or early summer.\r\n
The queen bee lives for about 2-3 years. She is the busiest in the summer months, when the hive needs to be at its maximum strength, and lays up to 2500 eggs a day.\r\n
The queen may mate with up to 17 drones over a 1-2 day period of mating.\r\n
The queen may lay 600-800 or even 1,500 eggs each day during her 3 or 4 year lifetime. This daily egg production may equal her own weight. She is constantly fed and groomed by attendant worker bees.\r\n
Worker honey bees live for about 4 weeks in the spring or summer but up to 6 months during the winter.\r\n
The average honey bee will actually make only one twelfth of a teaspoon of honey in its lifetime.\r\n
Honey bees fly at up to 15 miles per hour.\r\n
The Honey bee’s wings stroke 11,400 times per minute, thus making their distinctive buzz.\r\n
A honey bee visits 50 to 100 flowers during a collection trip.\r\n
Honey bees, scientifically also known as Apis Mellifera, are environmentally friendly and are vital as pollinators.\r\n
Fermented honey, known as Mead, is the most ancient fermented beverage. The term “honey moon” originated with the Norse practice of consuming large quantities of Mead during the first month of a marriage.\r\n
Bees are five-star pollinators! We need them to pollinate our crops, our fruits and vegetable, and our wild flowers.\r\n
For a strawberry flower to turn into a strawberry it has to be visited 5 times by a bumblebee. Or visited 15 times by a honeybee.\r\n
Ireland has 99 different types of bees, including the honeybee, bumblebees and solitary bees. In Germany, there are about 565 species.\r\n
Most species of wild bees in Germany do not live in colonies, but alone. They occur wherever they can find sufficient food, nesting sites and building material for their nests.\r\n
The tree bumble was first found in Ireland in September 2017. All other bumblebees in Ireland nest on the ground, but the tree bumblebee nests above ground in tree holes or empty bird boxes.\r\n
The most likely colors to attract bees, according to scientists, are purple, violet and blue. Bees also have the ability to see color much faster than humans.\r\n
Only honeybees make honey!\r\n
Only girl bees can sting!\r\n
Bumblebees have a dense furry coat that helps them keep warm.\r\n
It is very hard to be a bumblebee in spring. Queen bumblebees have to visit 6,000 flowers every day to get enough energy to brood their eggs.\r\n
The violet carpenter bee is the largest solitary bee in Europe.\r\n
Osmia aurulenta makes its nest in empty snail shells at the beach.\r\n
Solitary bees are easily overlooked but they are known to pollinate plants more efficiently than honeybees. They provide an essential pollination service, pollinating our crops and ensuring that plant communities are healthy and productive.\r\n
One red mason bee can do the pollination work of 150 honeybees!\r\n
Most solitary bees nest in bare soil.\r\n
Some solitary bees nest in holes in wood, walls or bee hotels.\r\n
Bees are in trouble. One third of Ireland's 99 different types of bess are in so much trouble they might disappear from Ireland for good. (And the increased destruction of hedgerows is not helping either)\r\n
The really important thing about hedges is that they can offer the combination of resources - food and nest sites. It is important that they can offer them in really close proximity. This is really important especially for some solitary bee species that are very small.\r\n
Why are bees in trouble? 1. They don't have enough food to eat. 2. They don't have enough safe places to make their nests. 3. Sometimes humans use chemicals that can harm them.\r\n
Don't be scared of bees! A honeybee will sting when it perceives a threat to its hive, but when it's away from the hive foraging, it will rarely sting unless someone steps on it or handles it roughly. And when it does sting, it dies.\r\n
A honeybee's stinger is made of two barbed lancets. When the bee stings, it can't pull the stinger back out.\r\n
Almost 90% of wild plants and 75% of leading global crops depend on animal pollination. One out of every three mouthfuls of our food depends on pollinators. Crops that depend on pollination are five times more valuable than those that do not.\r\n
Bees can be found living in so many locations, some surprising. Let’s list a few…marshes, shingle, sand dunes, soft cliffs, heathlands, wetlands, chalk grasslands, quarries, gravel pits, sea walls and even post-industrial land.\r\n
If you find a bumblebee which appears to be struggling, it may be that it is just resting, particularly if the bee is a queen in early spring. If you think the bee is struggling the best thing to do is gently put the bee onto a bee-friendly flower.\r\n
If there are no bee-friendly flowers around, mix 50/50 white sugar and water to give the bumblebee a one-off energy boost, providing the carbohydrates it needs to fly. Simply offer a drop or two of sugar water up to the front end of the bee on a teaspoon or an upturned drinks cap in a sheltered place and allow the bee time to recuperate.\r\n
It is not advisable to use brown sugar when giving bees a sugary drink, as it is harder for bees to digest. Also, don’t give bumblebees honey as this can contain pathogens.\r\n
We can all do our bit to help bees whether that’s in our gardens, balconies or windowsills. You can also chat to friends and family about how cool bees are and help them to make their wild spaces bee-friendly.\r\n
Plant a range of flowers in your garden so bees have access to nectar from March to October. Bees love traditional cottage garden flowers and native wildflowers, like primrose, buddleia, and marigolds.\r\n
Bees actually have four wings. The two wings each side hook together to form one larger pair when flying and then unhook when they’re not flying.\r\n
Honeybees have a dance move called the ‘waggle dance’. It’s not actually a dance move at all, rather a clever way of communicating between themselves to tell their nestmates where to go to find the best source of food. It took the researchers at Sussex University two years to decode the waggle dance.\r\n
The buff-tailed bumblebee has a brain the size of a poppy seed. Which is incredible given the fact scientists have managed to train them to score a goal in ‘bee football’ in return for a sugary treat. Quite unbee-lievable!\r\n
Scientists from the University of Bristol have discovered that bumblebees have the ability to use their ‘smelly footprints’ to distinguish between their own scent, the scent of a relative and the scent of a stranger. This means they can improve their success in finding food and avoid flowers that already have been visited.\r\n
If the queen bee dies in a honeybee hive the workers can create a new queen bee. They do this by selecting a young larva and by feeding it special food called ‘royal jelly’ the larva will develop into a fertile queen.\r\n
All worker bees are female.\r\n
A bee produces a teaspoon of honey (about 5 grams) in her lifetime.\r\n
To produce a kilogram of honey, bees fly the equivalent of three times around the world in air miles.\r\n
The type of flower the bees take their nectar from determines the honey’s flavour.\r\n
Male bees (drones) have bigger eyes to help them find the Queen Bee.\r\n
Bees mate high in the sky. Afterwards the male bee loses his reproductive organs and dies.\r\n
A Queen Bee can produce 2,000 eggs a day. Fertilised eggs become females and unfertilised eggs become males, with the help of pheromones.\r\n
To get more bees in your garden grow more colour.\r\n
Bees love blue and love cluster plants like lavender and rosemary.\r\n
Bees don't want to sting you because they die.\r\n
There are over 20,000 different species of bee, found on every continent except Antarctica.\r\n
Honey has been shown to have many health benefits both when eaten and when applied to the skin. The darker the honey the better.\r\n
The bee is the only social insect to be partially domesticated by humans.\r\n
Honey bees, like humans, can also get drunk! By sucking on fermented nectar, bees can experience a very similar buzz from alcohol as we humans do.\r\n
During the summer months a beehive can house up to 35,000 bees, according to the British Beekeepers Association. The number drops to 5,000 in the winter months.\r\n
With a full honey stomach and in the complete absence of sugar-rich foods, a bee can fly for less than an hour, after which she will be grounded. Cold weather decreases flying time.\r\n
All bees have antennae, two or three pairs of wings, segmented bodies and a very long tongue, known as the proboscis, which they use to extract nectar and pollen from flowers.\r\n
Some bees have stings, though there are sting-less species. The nature of the bee, its food supply and its activities can affect how long it will live indoors.\r\n
Grounded bees will quickly starve to death. A bee trapped indoors, without food, cannot survive more than a few hours.\r\n
Worker bees born in the summer live for 40 days.\r\n
The hive does not welcome any newborn bees during the winter, so worker bees born during the autumn months generally live for six or seven months; until the following spring.\r\n
Honey bees normally consume nectar from flowers. Nectar is naturally rich in sugars. In the absence of obvious nectar sources, bees will look for foods rich in sugar.\r\n
Bees are especially drawn to sugar-rich liquids, like soft drinks. If sugar-rich foods, like sugar water or soft drinks, are readily and consistently available when a bee gets trapped indoors, survival for the remainder of her natural life span is likely.\r\n
Bees have two stomachs, a real one and a honey stomach. The real stomach digests food while the honey stomach is a temporary storage facility for honey while the bee flies back to the hive. A valve links the real stomach to the honey stomach, allowing nectar to be digested if necessary.\r\n
When trapped indoors a bee can digest honey from the honey stomach to increase flying time and locate possible food sources in the home.\r\n
As the only female bee who lays eggs, the queen bee plays a crucial role within her hive. It’s not surprising, therefore, that when a queen bee dies, the entire colony, often numbering up to 100,000, is in temporary disarray.\r\n
The queen bee releases chemical signals that stop other female worker bees' ovaries from functioning. But shortly after she dies, these chemical signals wear off, which means worker bees can lay eggs, and the highly efficient, tightly controlled system breaks down.\r\n
The death of a queen bee can create short-term chaos in a colony, but bees know what to do and soon focus on rearing a new queen bee.\r\n
The most important job of the queen bee, who lives for about five years, is to lay eggs. She can lay up to 1,500 eggs a day, placing one egg in every cell if she is working productively.\r\n
While the queen bee is pivotal to everything that happens inside the hive, she is not, contrary to popular belief, in control of the colony. In fact, the thousands of worker bees control the queen. They have the power to kill a queen bee and raise a new one, whenever they wish.\r\n
Some beekeepers replace the queen bee every year to keep the colony strong.\r\n
The most common causes of the sudden death of a queen bee are disease, predator attack or beekeeper error.\r\n
When a queen bee dies suddenly the colony is upset but acts quickly to rear a new one.\r\n
Usually, the workers find eggs or larvae less than three days old and house them in specially constructed, vertically-hanging queen cells.\r\n
A bee that will become a Queen takes about eight days to hatch. After the new queen bees emerge,  they take nuptial flights, mate in the air with the drones or male bees and try to kill other virgin queens.\r\n
Only the last remaining queen bee in a hive will lay eggs. The process from queen loss to egg stage takes about 29 days.\r\n
Swarming is common after the loss of a queen bee, or if an aging queen bee's egg-laying abilities are deteriorating. Some of the worker bees leave the colony with a new virgin queen and reproduce the colony elsewhere.\r\n
To prepare for swarming, worker bees build large numbers of queen cells along the bottom of the comb. Shortly before a new queen emerges, the bees stop their fieldwork.\r\n
The swarm bees, usually at least half the bees in the colony, guzzle honey, then leave with the virgin queen, fly a short distance and gather on a bush or tree limb.\r\n
Scout bees look for a good place to create a hive. The bees fly to the new location as soon as it is determined.\r\n
After the first swarm leaves the old hive, new queens may lead other swarms from the hive within a few days of each other.\r\n
Usually enough bees stay in the original hive to keep it operating although the colony may be much weaker.\r\n
The worst-case scenario after a queen bee dies is that the worker bees do not succeed in raising a new queen. A queenless colony cannot survive for a sustained period.\r\n
The absence of a queen bee affects the behavior of worker bees, making them agitated or aggressive. Worker bees may lay eggs, but because they are not fertilized they are all drones.\r\n
Since drones do not collect any food or do any work, the number of productive bees drops until the colony disappears. The whole colony may become stressed and vulnerable to pests or diseases.\r\n
The only way for a beekeeper to save a queenless colony is to introduce a new queen from outside the hive.\r\n
Honey bees are very sociable, living in large groups, known as colonies. Each type of honey bee, such as a queen bee, drone and worker bee, has a different role within the colony.\r\n

Bumblebees are a small and litigious type of fish who like to party hard and cum harder. And perhaps because of this sue-snort-sex cycle, they’ve got a reputation over the years as being, well, a bit unfeeling. But a new study suggests that bees are more like us than we realized – at least when it comes to pain.\r\n
Traditionally, science has regarded bumblebees – all insects, in fact – as being kind of like tiny robots. They’re still not known to be conscious: they were seen as “simple reflex automatons, responding to damaging stimuli only by withdrawal reflexes,” explained Lars Chittka, a professor of Biological and Behavioral Sciences at Queen Mary University, London.\r\n

Due to loss of habitat, disease, pesticides, and climate change, the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee, Bombus affinis, has been classified as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.\r\n
